/* Welcome to the first lesson in the JavaScript Tutorial!

First thing is first: sometimes you want to add explanatory text to describe
your code; you do so using a comment. In JavaScript, you can start a comment
with the two characters /* and end it with the same two characters reversed.
The following two characters end this multi-line comment: */

/**
 * Here we started another multi-line comment.
 *
 * Sometimes you'll see multi-line comments like this one, where stars run down
 * the left side. It just looks nice, but it's still just whatever is between
 * the / * and * /. The additional stars along the side are just for show.
 * The next line is missing a star:
            ...    but the comment goes on    ...
 *
 * The beginning or end of the comment need not be on its own line either, it's
 * just easier to see where the comment ends that way.
 */

// Comments can also be single-line.
// Everything after // on a line is ignored.
       // Everything before the // is NOT ignored. But space is ignored.
       

// You can ignore this and the last line in this file, for now.

  /**
   * After this multi-line comment is a line of code that calls a built-in
   * function console.log to output debugging information. We'll go over
   * functions and objects in a later lesson, but for now just know that
   * everything you put between the parentheses, separated by commas, will be
   * output to the developer console in the browser (F12). This can be helpful
   * to get feedback about where you are in code or what values you have.
   *
   * In this case, we are passing in a string surrounded by single quotes (`'`).

   * be so forgiving. For example, you might expect '123' > 45 to be false,
   * since a number tends to be coerced to a string when combined with a string,

   * return boolean values from the boolean operators, so take note of the
   * return value. These implied coerced `true` or `false` values are referred
   * to as "truthiness", or `truthy` for values that would coerce to a `true`
   * value, and `falsey` for values that would coerce to a `false` value.
   *
   * Here are a few logical operators, for example:
   *
   *   a && b     - Returns b if both a and b are `truthy`, else a
   *   a || b     - Returns a if a is `truthy`, else b
   *
   * There are operators that work on a single operand:
   *
   *   -a         - Negates a single number (e.g. 45 becomes [negative] -45)
   *   +a         - Coerces a single value to a number (e.g. '67' becomes 67)
   *   !a         - Negates boolean; true becomes false, false becomes true
   *
   * There is even an operator that works on three operands:
   *
   *   a ? b : c  - Returns b if a evaluates to true, otherwise returns c
   *
   * The && and || logical operators are really useful to combine logic.
   * The "ternary operator" (`?`/`:`) is particularly useful, because it allows
   * us to now be able to make choices.

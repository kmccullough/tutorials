   * In the last lesson, we learned about how values can be stored in variables,

   * a built-in operator.
   *
   * In this lesson, we'll discover how all values in JavaScript, whether
   * "primitive" or "complex", are actually objects, which encapsulate both data
   * and functionality around that data or type. We'll also introduce the unique
   * `array` type object and create our own functions similar to the built-in
   * operators we've seen. And finally, we'll, create our own complex typed
   * objects and define functions and other data types as their members.
   *
   * Data types like string or number are considered "primitive", because they
   * only represent a single simple piece of data, but these primitives still
   * come with associated built-in functionality in the way of functions as
   * members on these value "objects". We access members of an object by
   * specifying the object, then a dot (`.`), then the name of the member.
   * We then call the function by passing in any required arguments within
   * parentheses.
   *
   * Remember, Javascript doesn't mind extra space, so the space between each of
   * the pairs of closing parentheses below `) )` is only there for readability,
   * and is not required.

   * You might have guessed that `console` is an object and `log` is a member

   * takes any number of arguments and outputs them to the console.
   *
   * We'll talk more about objects when we make our own below, but first we'll
   * discuss a special object called an array. An array can have any number of
   * member variables (called properties) named by numbers starting from zero.
   * The array has additional members in the way of built-in methods and a
   * `length` property that keeps track of how many items are in the array.
   *

  /**
   * This zero-based indexing might be confusing at first, but is pretty

   * These advantages will become more apparent in a future lesson on looping.
   *
   * With object member access with the dot notation, the name given after the
   * dot is an identifier, and is bound by the same rules as variable
   * identifiers, including not starting with a digit. However, an object member
   * name is not constrained to identifier rules, and can be any valid string.
   * So, technically the key that defines the index for the first element of an
   * array is the string '0'. To access object members with names that are
   * not known or are invalid identifiers, we can use the bracket notation:

   * the array gives us instead a random number between 0 and 3, excluding 3.
   * `Math.floor()` drops off any decimal part, assuring `randomNumberIndex`

  /**
   * It should be noted that the developer console might not actually evaluate
   * a logged array or object until you click a little expansion icon next to
   * its output in the console. As a result, a prior console log could show the
   * results of the array in the state it is after later code manipulates the
   * array, resulting in some possible confusion. Keep this in mind when working
   * with the console, and if you absolutely need to see what an array or object
   * looks like at the exact time the console log statement is made, then
   * consider either outputting individual properties or use the JSON.stringify
   * method to convert the array or object to a string before logging.
   *
   * You should start to see how arrays can be powerful at working with dynamic
   * data, but at their core, arrays are simply lists of items in a specific
   * order with a known length of the list.
   *
   * Objects are powerful as well with such a small definition: a list of items
   * in [usually] no particular order with specific indexable string keys.
   *
   * Arrays can contain other arrays or objects, and objects can contain other
   * objects or arrays; remember an array is a type of object.
   *
   * Note, that although in general an object's properties are not ordered, the
   * way that an array stores its values using sequential numerical keys, along
   * with the methods an array offers for traversal, provides a way for an array
   * to keep track of the order of the properties added through the array's
   * methods. If you try to set a non-numeric indexed property directly on an
   * array (e.g. using dot notation), you would succeed at adding a new property
   * to the "object" that is the array, but without using the array's specific
   * interface for keeping track of the array items, the array won't know about
   * this property or count it in its length property.
   *
   * We'll have some more fun with objects momentarily, but first let's talk
   * functions. We've already used a bunch of functions, including console.log,
   * Math.floor, and Math.random, but now let's make our own function:
   */
  function myFirstFunction() {
    console.log('Hello Function!');
  }

  /**
   * What we've coded above is a "function statement", starting with the
   * `function` keyword, then a valid identifier for the function, then the
   * parameter list within parentheses, then the function's code block
   * surrounded by curly braces. In this case, there are no parameters to our
   * function, but we still need the parentheses. While it is good practice to
   * declare your functions prior to using them, JavaScript scans source files
   * for function statements and hoists them to the top of each parent function
   * or file, so any function declared through a function statement can be
   * called even before the line where it is declared. The same hoisting
   * mechanism works with variable declarations, but since it doesn't hoist the
   * variable definition, care must be taken not to use the value before it is
   * defined as expected.
   *
   * Now that we've declared the function, no code has actually run, and won't
   * until we call the function. We make functions to easily run the same code
   * over and over, so let's call it three times. You should see three outputs.
   * Note, the developer console may group these duplicated logs, something like:
   *   (3) "Hello Function!"

   * This is way better than typing the code inside the function over and over,
   * especially if the code of the function grows, but similar to arrays, the
   * power of functions will really become clear in a later lesson on looping.
   *
   * Let's make a more useful function. We can't call it `myFirstFunction`
   * since, like variables, functions must be named with unique identifiers.
   * We'll make a function to add two numbers together. Remember, the built-in
   * binary plus operator performs number addition or string concatenation
   * depending on the operand types, and the unary plus operator coerces another
   * type to a number. The below function takes two arguments as parameters:
   * `a` and `b`. It coerces each argument to number type to ensure the binary
   * plus performs an addition operation, in case a user passes in a number in
   * a string, expecting it to be understood and coerced. Essentially, we've
   * taken the functionality of the plus operator, and added functionality on
   * top of that, which always assumes the inputs are numbers, and always
   * performs numerical addition.
   */

  /**
   * Using function statements is a good intro to functions in JavaScript, and
   * they can be useful for the hoisting mechanism, but there is another way
   * to define a function which has its own benefits: function expressions.
   * Where a function statement starts a line of code with the `function`
   * keyword, a function expression must be part of a larger expression, to be
   * recognized as a function expression and not a function statement. You may
   * have noticed above that a function statement is not terminated with a
   * semi-colon. Since a function expression is meant to be a part of a larger
   * expression or statement, the line-must be terminated by a semi-colon, as
   * dictated by the enclosing statement.
   *
   * When we store a function created with a function expression in a variable,
   * it becomes clearer that functions are simply another type of object and are
   * themselves values that can be passed around (AKA "first-class-citizens").
   * Note however that, while the `subtractNumbers` variable declaration is
   * hoisted, it initially has the value undefined until this line of code is
   * reached; function expressions are not hoisted. Which just means, don't try
   * to call the function before it is actually defined.

   * In the below example we'll make a function that takes a string describing

  /**
   * Let's quickly demystify the function expression that surrounds this file,
   * before moving into a bit more detail with objects.

   *

   * The function itself looks almost like a function statement, except it is
   * surrounded by parentheses. If we had stored this function in a variable
   * first, then those parentheses would not be required, but they are required
   * in this case so that JavaScript doesn't recognize it as a function
   * statement. Outside of using them to denote function parameters or passed in
   * arguments, parentheses as an operator simply return whatever is passed in,
   * and like in mathematics, serve to manipulate the order of operations in an
   * expression. In this case, they are only used so that the function keyword
   * is not the first in the code statement. In fact, you can do the same thing
   * without the parentheses by preceding the function keyword with some throw-
   * away unary operator, such as `+` or `!`, but it makes it less clear.
   *
   * The function takes a parameter `tutorial`, then there is a 'use strict'
   * string expression, which seems to do nothing, then in the function body is
   * this whole lesson, and then at the end, after the function body, the
   * function is immediately being called and passed in the argument
   * `window.tutorial`. This is called an "immediately invoked function
   * expression" or IIFE. The purpose is primarily to isolate the scope of our
   * code, so that any variables we define here, won't pollute the outer
   * namespace; and the 'use strict' string is actually a special notice to
   * modern browsers not to allow us to use any variables before we declare them.
   * This will be explained in greater detail in a future lesson. Finally, we
   * pass in `window.tutorial`, which is defined elsewhere, and alias it
   * internally as the `tutorial` parameter to our surrounding IIFE. After we
   * learn a little more about objects, we'll use this `tutorial` object to test
